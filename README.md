# CDS_heat_stress_indicators
Equations for calculating heat stress indicators for CMIP6 models published on CDS

This repository provides the equations that are used to calculate the following heat stress indicators:
<ol>
<li>Heat Index</li>
<li>Humidex</li>
<li>Universal Thermal Climate Index</li>
<li>Wet-Bulb Temperature</li>
<li>Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature</li>
</ol>

The heat stress indicators were calculated for CMIP6 models and are going to be published on the [C3S Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).

More details about the heat stress indicators can be found in [Schwingshackl et al.(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001885).
